# Idea
Of the tennis players that play both singles and doubles, can we predict doubles partnerships based on head 2 head counts of one against the other?

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)

setwd("C:/Users/dadak/Desktop/personal-projects/tennis-network")

doubles2020 = read_csv("data/atp_matches_doubles_2020.csv") # Claims that there's problems, but it looks fine to me...
doubles2019 = read_csv("data/atp_matches_doubles_2019.csv")
doubles2018 = read_csv("data/atp_matches_doubles_2018.csv")
df = bind_rows(doubles2018, doubles2019, doubles2020)

winners = df %>% select(winner1_name, winner2_name) %>% rename(from = winner1_name, to = winner2_name)
losers = df %>% select(loser1_name, loser2_name) %>% rename(from = loser1_name, to = loser2_name)

g = graph_from_data_frame(winners)
plot(g, vertex.label=NA)
```
